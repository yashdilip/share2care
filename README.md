Share2Care (Let's make event success)

This will be a web-based project which allows the user to borrows resources from his/her circle to carry out an event successfully. A user will have circle having friends and he/she can request for resources from event-sub-circle friends to organize an event. So that user wonâ€™t have to buy things by own for few days or for a few hour event.
